Big Rico's Pizza is the best pizza place in Night Vale. Its also the only pizza
place in Night Vale, due to an unsolved arson case years ago in which all
pizzerias but Big Rico's burned to the ground. It's owner, Big Rico himself,
studies taxidermy as a hobby and will be happy to help if you need your pet spayed
or neutered. Just come by!
