Carlos--:--Carlos is an interloper. He came from some prestigious academy somewhere far off,
into our town and all of our hearts. A year after his arrival, he began dating Cecil Palmer,
the radio host. But that's just gossip.

Carlos and his team of scientists have scribbled many things on clipboards, taken readings 
from many computers, written the word "SCIENCE" multiple times in different fonts, and generally 
have just been a great help to the town of Night Vale.
