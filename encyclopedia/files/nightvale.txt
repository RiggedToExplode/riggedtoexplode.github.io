Night Vale--:--"A friendly desert community where the sun is hot, the moon is beautiful, 
and mysterious lights pass overhead while we all pretend to sleep. Welcome to Night Vale." -Cecil Palmer
<br>---<br>
Night Vale is our friendly little desert community, located somewhere in the Southwest. It
is like most other towns. And, it is not like most other towns. We have a bowling alley, a radio station,
a City Hall, and of course, a used car lot ful of snarling droolig beasts.
